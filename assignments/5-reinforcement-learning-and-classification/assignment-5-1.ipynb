First, how do we learn about the world? This involves both the\n","problem of modeling our initial uncertainty about the world, and that of drawing conclusions from evidence and our initial belief. Secondly, given what we\n","currently know about the world, how should we decide what to do, taking into\n","account future events and observations that may change our conclusions?\n","Typically, this will involve creating long-term plans covering possible future\n","eventualities. That is, when planning under uncertainty, we also need to take\n","into account what possible future knowledge could be generated when implementing our plans. Intuitively, executing plans which involve trying out new\n","things should give more information, but it is hard to tell whether this information will be beneficial.

An *agent* moves between *states* in a *state space* choosing *actions* that affects the transition probabilities between states, and the subsequent *rewards* recieved after a jump. This is then repeated a finite or infinite number of epochs. The objective, or the *solution* of the MDP, is to optimize the accumulated rewards of the process.\n","\n","Thus, an MDP consists of five parts: \n","\n","* Decision epochs: $t={1,2,...,T}$, where $T\\leq \\infty$\n","* State space: $S=\\{s_1,s_2,...,s_N\\}$ of the underlying environment\n","* Action space $A=\\{a_1,a_2,...,a_K\\}$ available to the decision maker at each decision epoch\n","* Transition probabilities $p(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t)$ for jumping from state $s_t$ to state $s_{t+1}$ after taking action $a_t$\n","* Reward functions $R_t = r(a_t,s_t,s_{t+1})$ resulting from the chosen action and subsequent transition\n","\n","A *decision policy* is a function $\\pi: s \\rightarrow a$, that gives instructions on what action to choose in each state. A policy can either be *deterministic*, meaning that the action is given for each state, or *randomized* meaning that there is a probability distribution over the set of possible actions for each state. Given a specific policy $\\pi$ we can then compute the the *expected total reward* when starting in a given state $s_1 \\in S$, which is also known as the *value* for that state, \n","\n","$$V^\\pi (s_1) = E\\left[ \\sum_{t=1}^{T} r(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1}) {\\Large |} s_1\\right] = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} r(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1}) p(s_{t+1} | a_t,s_t)$$ \n","\n","where $a_t = \\pi(s_t)$. To ensure convergence and to control how much credit to give to future rewards, it is common to introduce a *discount factor* $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$. For instance, if we think all future rewards should count equally, we would use $\\gamma = 1$, while if we value near-future rewards higher than more distant rewards, we would use $\\gamma < 1$.

Here we will focus on the simplest form of Q-learning algorithms, which can be applied when all states are known to the agent, and the state and action spaces are reasonably small.
